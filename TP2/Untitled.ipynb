    "> By Theorems 3.1 and 3.2, the problem of finding a minimum total dominating set in an interval graph has been reduced to that of finding a shortest path in an appropriate network with some\n",
    "sequencing constraints on certain arcs. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">However, the latter problem can in turn be reduced to an ordinary shortest path problem.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">To see this, we define another directed network D' by splitting each node i, 1 < i < n, into two nodes, say i_in and i_out.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">These two nodes are joined by the arc (i_in, i_out) , whose length is zero.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">For each arc (i, j) in B, we introduce in D' the arc (i_out, j_in) with unit length.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">For each arc (i, j) in C, instead, we introduce in D' the arc (i_in, j_out) , also with unit length.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Lastly, for each arc (0, i) in A we add to D' the arc (0, i_out) with zero length,\n",
    "while for each arc (i, n+1) in A we add to D' the arc (i_in, n + 1) with unit length.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">One can readily check that a shortest path in D' between nodes 0 and n + 1 corresponds to a minimum total dominating set in which interval I_i in I is included if and only if either i_in or i_out or both are crossed by the path.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">It is easy to see that D' can be constructed directly from I in O(n^2) time. Moreover, D' is acyclic, too. Then, a shortest path in D' can be found in O(n^2) time [10]. Thus, the overall time complexity to find a minimum total dominating set in an interval graph is O(n^2)."
